<p>Stop jumping on the trick-or-treaters!

Teach your dog “sit”

Grab a dog treat and hold it right at the end of your dog’s nose.

Slowly move the treat up their snout and over their head. As they try to keep their eyes on the treat, they’ll wind up sitting.

When they do, praise them and give them the treat.

Now start saying “sit!” at the beginning of this process. With sufficient practice and consistent rewards, your dog will sit at the command.

Don’t run towards the doorbell!

Teach your dog “wait”

Invite your dog to sit and then say, “wait”. If your dog does so for even a split second, respond with praise and a treat.

Practice keeping your dog still for one second, then two, and work your way up over the next few days.

Once your dog has the idea, practice this while opening and closing the door.

Get away from that candy corn!

Teach your dog “leave it”

Grab a boring, run-of-the-mill treat, like a dry biscuit.

When your dog gets bored of trying to get the biscuit, praise them and give them a better treat — like a soft chewy treat.

Repeat the whole exercise and say, “leave it!” when your pup tries to get the boring, out-of-reach treat. Repeat the exercise with other, yummier treats, each time rewarding your dog with something tastier when they leave it.
